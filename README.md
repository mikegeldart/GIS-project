My GIS project code and Rmarkdown document

My project will attempt to map the South African distribution of Perlemoen, which is the South African Abalone (Haliotis midae). I used iNaturalist to extract observations. These observations were then used to create a map which gives insight into the distribution of Haliotis midae. 

Perlemoen are generally only found in higher densities along the Western and Southern coast, in their optimal temperature range. The Perlemoen has a low temperature tolerance and doesnâ€™t occur in water temperatures much higher than 18 degrees Celsius. The optimal temperature range for the Perlemoen is between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius. Abalone are also limited by food availability. Their diet mainly consists of Kelp which occurs in high densities on the western and southern coast.

I created 2 maps. both show the distribution of Perlemoen, but one of them is an interactive map. Creating an interactive map may help prospective farmers to view where higher density of abalone exist along the coastline.
